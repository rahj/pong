Open Sourcing a classic Ping Pong game i have written a long time ago. The Menu is not yet finish, however, the overall player is done and the scoring board is done. <br/><br/>
I will also be releasing some of the old applications i have written in the past, so please watch out for it. 

<br/>
About the Game: <br/>
It is a single player classic ping pong game vs a simple classic computer artificial intelligence implementation named "Uncle Jun" which is what my nephews and nieces call me at home.
The menu is still unfinished and i already has no time to finished it, however, if i have spare time, i will try to update and finished the menu section.
